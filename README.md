# Generative_AI_in_cyber_security

Shows how the security professionals will detect, respond, and predict the threats. 
This technology depends on machine learning models mainly which depend on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
This technology can be used to simulate the cyber attacks and defensive mechanisms.

Using generative AI we can able to create new datasets that resemble the real world datasets thus allowing new cyber threats to occur. As these AI models are trained, they get better at understanding the details of security data. This allows them to spot subtle signs of harmful activity that traditional methods might miss.

Generative AI is a powerful tool for those who want to perform cyber attack and it is equally powerful tool for mitigating and preventing the risks of cybercrimes.

Generative AI became essential in preventing cyber attacks and for threat mitigations in security event and incident management (SIEM) and security operations centers (SOCs). In SOCs the generative AI can detect ransomware, malware or unusual network traffic which are not present in traditional systems.

Data analysis and anomaly detection are done in SIEM systems using generative AI. 

# Generative AI benefits in cyber security

Have the ability to identify the cyber attacks efficiently. 
Since it's depend on deep learning models, generative AI can simulate advanced attack scenarios which are crucial for testing and for enhacing the cyber security systems. Using this simulation capability we can develop a strong defense against known as well as for emerging threats.

It also points out the implementation of security protocols. It also plays a pivotal role in training, providing realistic and dynamic scenarios that help improve the decision-making skills of IT security professionals.

Generative AI's should maintain integrity and resilience of cyber security infrastructures.
